## About the Project
This is another homework assignment for the UofA coding bootcamp. 
In this project the use of npm was helpful as was Inquirer for obtaining user input, and Jest for testing purposes. 
There are four test files which show that the objects can be created, and that the valuess can be obtained inorder to 
be written to .html.
 

## Technologies used
HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript- Utilizing Node.js with npm, jest & inquirer

## Future Scope
I hope to add firstname/lastname keys and continue to add to the available input.
Further styling of the command interface and the html output is a goal as well.

## Licence
N/A

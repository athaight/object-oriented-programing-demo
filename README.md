## Installation Instructions
First, clone the repo. 

If it has not been done already, you will need to install Node.js in your environment. 
This should be easily achieved by visiting: <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">nodejs.org</a> and following the 
download instructions.

###
Clone the repo:
```
git clone git@github.com:athaight/object-oriented-programing-demo.git
```

Once the you've cloned the repo and opened it in VS Code you'll want to 
right click the index.js file and open in intergrated terminal. 
In the terminal enter the following:
###
To install npm:
```
npm i
```
###

Once npm has installed completely enter the following command:
```
node index.js
```
###
This should begin the application in the terminal and output the generatedHTML.html file as end result into the /dis directory.

## About the Project
This is another homework assignment for the UofA coding bootcamp. 
In this project the use of npm was helpful as was Inquirer for obtaining user input, and Jest for testing purposes. 
There are four test files which show that the objects can be created, and that the values can be obtained and can 
be written to a .html file.
 

## Technologies used
HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript- Utilizing Node.js with npm, jest & inquirer

## Future Scope
I hope to add firstname/lastname keys and continue to add to the available input.
Further styling of the command interface and the html output is a goal as well.

## Licence
N/A
